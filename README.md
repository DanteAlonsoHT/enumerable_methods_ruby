# Advanced Building Blocks - Bubble Sort

> In this project, I've implemented my own enumerable methods creating this functions from scratch using Ruby.

This project is created to improve the skills using Ruby, for this reason, you can use this code to see how Ruby works and to check out if you can implement this code for one of your Ruby projects.

**The first function "bubble_sort()" is used to sort an INT array**

The input for the first fuction is
<pre>
array_trial_int = [10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
</pre>

The output for the first fuction is
<pre>
> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
</pre>

As you can see if you use this functions you might be able to see how the results are very similar than using the normal functions in Ruby.
